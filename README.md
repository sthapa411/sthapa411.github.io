What changes I made to my homework html files -
I linked the html file to the corresponding css file so that the content of my website would be more appealing because of the different style that a css file would allow me to apply to my website. Such as adding image, background of the webpage, its color, size of different elements and their placement. 
I added "alt" for the images for that file as it was missing. 

For CSS file - 
I decided to keep the heading on the left and apply different font-family to "h1" . Class applied to "h1" allowed me to apply different fontfamily although its one word.
I utilized different classes to give specific format for its contents, including padding, color, image size, text-align etc.
I used relative positioning to put my boxes in the body part of the web page; utilized "float" property to float the images left and right. 
For body, I decided to use the picture as background attachment, without repeating the picture again. 
I used "overflow" for "x axis" to be hidden as I wanted my webpage to scroll up and down only.
I decided to put the elements of "class=benifits" together vertically to group it together and to differ the style from the above boxes for the previous classes.
I decided to put the footer in the center and give it different font color to differenciate it from body part of the website.
